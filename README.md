# BSNightCorePC

A Beat Saber PC mod that **removes pitch compensation globally** so songs go *NIGHTCORE*...

## Installation

1. Place `BSNightCore.dll` into your Beat Saber `Plugins/` folder.  
2. Launch Beat Saber.

## Compatibility

- Tested and verified working on 1.40.8, not sure about other versions.

## Usage

No in-game menu configuration is required. Once installed, pitch compensation is disabled automatically and globally.  
To change it back to normal, remove the mod from your `Plugins/` folder and restart the game.

## Contributing

Please contribute because I'm new to this and I need help ironing out the bugs!
