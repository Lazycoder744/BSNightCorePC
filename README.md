# BSNightCorePC

A Beat Saber PC mod that **removes pitch compensation globally** so songs go *NIGHTCORE*...

## Installation

1. Place `BSNightCore.dll` into your Beat Saber `Plugins/` folder.  
2. Launch Beat Saber.

> There are no other dependencies other than BSIPA of course

## Compatibility

- Tested and verified working on 1.40.8, not sure about other versions

## Usage

No in-game menu configuration is required. Once installed, pitch compensation is disabled automatically and globally.  
To change it back to normal, remove the mod from your `Plugins/` folder and restart the game.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or pull requests for code improvements, compatibility fixes, or feature additions. I don't know how to make a toggle switch or anything fancy like that so please help me :)
